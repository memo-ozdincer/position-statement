            <h2>Engineering Design Philosophy</h2>
            <div class="text-with-image">
                <div class="content">
                    <p>In this position statement I reflect on how I engage with engineering design. My position is a reflection of my completed projects and past experiences, rather than constructed ideals; thus, for each position statement, I will aim to provide a connection to the motivating experience.</p>
                    <p>I aim to justify concious decisions I have made in the past, and to identify and reflect on my subconcious patterns, relating each to my underlying values and experiences, and vocalizing a set of values that motivate me.</p>
                    <h3>Motivation and Core Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>Through my experiences in Praxis I and other projects both in courses and in design teams, I found that: <b>unexpected connections that emerge when we allow ourselves to think beyond conventional boundaries while maintaining a systematic framework.</b></p></p>
                    <p>My engineering design process presupposes that the best solution to complex problems is usually both: 1. the most creative and 2. most painstaking, with the <b>huge</b> caveat that it is also usually the simplest and easiest to communicate.</p>
                    <p>Getting to such a solution is difficult, and makes it necessary to be methodical. So, my model, unlike the FDCR model, requires a linear progression, especially for the first time I go through it. It goes as follows:</p>

                <h3>1. Idea Flow: The Foundation/Familiarity</h3>
                <div class="text-with-image">
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The foundation of my design process begins with <b>exposure.</b> Much like attending a lecture or reading a book where I don’t fully understand everything, I have found that I am significantly more effective when I am at least exposed to the ideas I will be working with—even if it’s just being able to name them.</p>
                        <p>I create an environment where thoughts can emerge naturally, allowing my brain to lay the schematic—or at least establish connections between topics—without immediate judgment or constraint. This approach aligns with the <b>Frame phase of the FDCR model</b>, where understanding the problem space requires an open mind and multiple perspectives. I apply this approach not only in engineering design but also in class, when reading difficult books, or when starting any project.</p>
                        <div class="key-concept"><b>CONNECTION:</b> when I first joined the UTAT design team, I knew nothing about circuit design. Rather than reading a book or watching a software tutorial, I started by looking at schematics, and videos designing the exact types of circuits the team did. I valued exposure to relevant over deep understanding initially, which helped me save significant time.</div>

                <div class="text-with-image">
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>After gaining familiarity, I <b>identify the most difficult aspects and ideas,</b> as they are often the most fruitful, and allow for the least amount of time-waste.</p>
                        <p>Another way to put this is that I seek out ideas and solutions that make me uncomfortable or seem initially unfeasible. I love exploring this discomfort, as it is the easiest signal to see where I have a knowledge gap (can't think of a solution immediately). <b>If I find the knowledge gap in one area of the project, chances are, addressing it will help me in other areas of it.</b></p>
                        <div class="key-concept">
                        <p><b>CONNECTION:</b> This approach was evident in my Process Analysis in ESC101, where my thesis was: spending time on singular tangents in the project lead to our greatest breakthrough moments.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>This is the simplest section, since, the effectiveness is directly proportional to the time input: <b>the more time I spend in deep focus, the more ideas I generate.</b> Deep focus means two things: <br><br>1. Small scope (of the project) <br>2. No distractions (one long work session > many smaller sessions)</p>
                        <p>Once ideas begin flowing and I've identified challenging areas, I try to focus as intensely as possible at one issue. This is not counterproductive, or ignoring other parts of the project, in fact the ideas that come out of this part are usually the most applicable.</p>
                        <div class="key-concept"><b>CONNECTION:</b> I had to find what was causing jitter in my servo driver. Rather than brainstorming or reading about it, I sat down with the servo controller board, looked at it for hours, and wrote down what I thought. I saw the signal pin was not built to handle any significant current, and decided to test it (Figure 4). This was the issue.</div>

                <h3>4. Structured Communication: The Bridge</h3>
                <div class="text-with-image">
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The final phase involves communication. Simply put, it is a reflection of what I did in the last three steps, and communicating the key parts to others. <b>A fresh set of eyes is the most robust and effetive reality check,</b> as long as you made you communicated your work clearly, or even better, made it inherently clear.</p>
                        <p>Usually, this is documentation (just like our Design Report). In terms of FDCR, this corresponds most pointedly to R - representing. However, it informs all strands, as a catalyst for further iteration or refinement of ideas.</p>
                        <p>Much like FDCR, after this, I can go back to whichever part of the 4-step process is most fitting.</p>
                        <div class="key-concept"><b>CONNECTION:</b> Preparing the design report was the ultimate form of structured communication. Prior to writing anything, we had to converse as a team. Every person needed to communicate what they did to other members team and we needed to bring it together. Then, we communicated this to the outside world, by, together, creating the design report.</div>

            <h3>Areas for Growth</h3>
            <p>I acknowledge that my current position has major limitations. While my process emphasizes individual deep focus, I really wish to better implement collaborative ideation in all stages.</p>
            <p>I also wish to recognize that my approach is still evolving. The four-step process I've outlined emerged from specific experiences—particularly in Praxis I and my design team work—but I expect it to develop further <b>as I engage with more diverse stakeholders and increasingly complex design challenges.</b></p>
